# Text analysis of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey texts in Ancient Greek

To get started, run the following:

```
$ nix develop --impure
$ poetry run python -m analyzer
```

Currently waiting for http://nlpl.eu/ website to get back up, because they have
Ancient Greek models that I want to download, but the website is down.
